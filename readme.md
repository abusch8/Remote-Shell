# Remote Shell

**Compilation:**
```
make
```

**Execute server:**
```
./server port hostname
```
Hostname argument is optional.  It allows you to specify a custom hostname for the server.  By default, the server will use your machine's hostname.


**Execute client:**
```
./client ip port
```
You can enter `localhost` in the ip argument to conveniently connect to 127.0.0.1.  Just typing out the ip obviously works as well.
